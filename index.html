		<h2><u>Summary</u></h2>
		<p>The 2022 Oscars were full of surprises but the best movies from 2021 each still had their well-deserved moment. 
		Each film nominated for best picture was also nominated in at least two other categories. While each film had multiple nominations,
		not each film won an award; for example, <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Nightmare Alley</span> and <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Don't Look Up</span> 
		were both nominated in 4 categories but neither won an award. 
		Even though not every film won an award, being nominated for an Oscar is a high honor and each film and everyone who worked on them
		should be extremely proud.</p>
		<p>The film to win the best picture was <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Coda</span>. <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Coda</span> is a coming-of-age 
		drama about a girl, Ruby, who is the child of two deaf parents 
		and is the only hearing person in the home. In the film, Ruby faces the challenge of following her own dreams or staying with her 
		family and fulfilling her familial obligations. The film was nominated and won three awards: best picture, best-supporting actor, 
		and best-adapted screenplay. <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Coda</span> is an emotional and beautiful film whose wins were well deserved.
		Here is a quote from Richard Brody, a writer for "The New Yorker", on <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Coda</span>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/coda-is-a-feel-bad-feel-good-movie">
The movie itself displays an authentic and significant merit, which is to offer large and dramatically vigorous roles to three deaf actors of 
extraordinary talent, and their performances give the movie a semblance of vitality and of presence that leaps beyond the confines of the script.
</blockquote>
		<p>A film worth mentioning for its high number of Oscar wins is <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Dune</span>. <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Dune</span> was nominated 
		for 10 awards and won 6: best cinematography,
		best film editing, best original score, best production design, best sound, and best visual effects. <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Dune</span> was an incredible 
		film that paved a new standard for film production that most certainly will influence the industry for years to come. Director, Denis Villeneuve, 
		has made many great films in the past and the <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Dune</span> franchise is off to a very promising start with him behind it. The franchise will most 
		certainly be one to keep an eye on in the future.</p>
